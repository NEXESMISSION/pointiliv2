  WHICH BUILD THIS IS — the one string the running app can compare itself to.

  A browser never reuses a Pointili page: every HTML response is `no-store`. So
  a NAVIGATION always gets the new deploy. What does not is a tab that is
  already open — and after the first load this app is a single page, so the till
  a shop leaves running behind the counter, and an installed PWA window that is
  never closed, go on executing the JavaScript they launched with. For days.

  That is the "cache problem" people report, and it has a sharp edge: the next
  deploy DELETES the content-hashed chunks the old bundle still expects, so the
  first screen that needs one dies with a ChunkLoadError — a blank or broken
  page that a hard refresh fixes and nothing else does.

  `env` here is a BUILD-TIME substitution: every `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_ID`
  in the source, on the client AND on the server, is replaced by this literal
  while the bundle is compiled. That is exactly the property the check needs —
  the browser holds the id of the build it downloaded, /api/version answers with
  the id of the build that is serving now, and they differ only when there has
  been a deploy. Nothing reads it at runtime, so `next start` re-evaluating this
  file with a different Date.now() changes nothing.

  A commit SHA when the platform offers one, because it is stable across a
  rebuild of the same code; a timestamp otherwise.

/*
  WHERE THIS RUNS IS NOT IN THIS FILE — see vercel.json.

  It was in iad1 (Washington), and the database is in eu-central-2 (Zurich).
  Every query a page made therefore crossed the Atlantic and came back:
  `X-Vercel-Id: cdg1::iad1::…` — a customer in Tunis reached the Paris edge,
  which forwarded to Virginia, which talked to Switzerland. The measured cost of
  one such round trip is written down in proxy.ts, which calls the auth check
  "90–230ms"; a page makes several, in waves, and they add up in front of the
  first byte.

  vercel.json pins the functions to fra1 (Frankfurt), ~300km from the database
  and much nearer the people using this. Nothing in the code changes; the same
  queries simply stop crossing an ocean twice.

  It is NOT `export const preferredRegion`. On Vercel that option only applies
  to routes running on the edge runtime, and this app cannot: proxy.ts is
  explicitly Node ("edge is not supported here"), and the data layer uses the
  Supabase and pg clients. Setting it on a Node route is ignored at best.

  The dashboard has the same setting (Project → Functions → Function Region).
  If the two ever disagree, believe the deployment, not this comment.

    A BUILD CAN BE RUN WITHOUT KILLING A DEV SERVER.

    `next build` and `next dev` both write to .next, and a build performed while
    a dev server is running corrupts it — every route then 500s until the dev
    server is restarted and the directory cleared. That is fine when one person
    is working, and it means "verify the build" and "keep the app running" are
    mutually exclusive the moment two are.

    NEXT_DIST_DIR sends a verification build somewhere else:

        NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-verify npm run build

    Unset — which is every normal build and every deploy — this is exactly the
    default, so nothing about the shipped output changes.

    ONE THING TO PUT BACK AFTERWARDS: Next appends its own type paths to
    tsconfig.json on every build, so a run with this set leaves
    ".next-verify/types/**" in `include` pointing at a directory that is about
    to be deleted. `git checkout tsconfig.json` after the build.
