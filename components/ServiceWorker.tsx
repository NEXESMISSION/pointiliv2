/**
 * Registers public/sw.js, once, for the whole origin — and keeps it honest.
 *
 * Separate from InstallPrompt on purpose. The worker is what makes the SITE
 * installable — Chrome will not offer to install an origin whose worker does not
 * handle `fetch` — and that has to be true on every page, including the landing
 * and /cartes. The prompt is only the UI that ASKS, and it deliberately appears
 * on a couple of screens and on phones only.
 *
 * They were one component at first, which quietly meant the worker was only ever
 * registered on /[slug] and /owner: a customer sitting on their wallet, the most
 * likely place to install from, had nothing registered at all.
 *
 * STAYING FRESH BY ITSELF
 *
 * An installed app has no reload button and nobody to press it. Three things
 * here make "close it and open it again" unnecessary — which matters because
 * that instruction is useless to a shop owner mid-service, and because a
 * standalone window is often never closed at all.
 *
 * ALL THREE ARE ABOUT THE WORKER, AND ONLY THE WORKER. Point 3 reloads when a
 * NEW WORKER takes over, and sw.js is a static file that does not change
 * between deploys — so on an ordinary release that event never fires and this
 * component does nothing at all. The tab still running last week's JavaScript
 * is components/StayFresh's problem, and it is a different mechanism.
 *
 * Renders nothing. Failure is silent by design: an unregistrable worker costs
 * the install offer and nothing else, and the app must not care.

      3 · When a NEW worker takes over, reload once.

      sw.js calls skipWaiting() + clients.claim(), so a new worker controls the
      page the moment it activates — but the page itself is still running the
      markup and scripts it loaded before that. Reloading here is what turns a
      deploy into something the user actually has.

      Guarded twice. `had` is false on the very first registration (there was no
      controller to change FROM) and reloading then would bounce every
      first-time visitor for nothing. `done` makes it once per page, because a
      reload can itself trigger another controllerchange and two guards are
      cheaper than an infinite refresh loop on somebody's till.
