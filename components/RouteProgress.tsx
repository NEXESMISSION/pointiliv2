/**
 * ── SOMETHING HAPPENED WHEN YOU PRESSED THAT ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * This app used to answer every navigation with a full-screen logo. That was
 * wrong — it threw away the screen you were reading to tell you something you
 * could already see — so it went, and it was replaced with a lit tab in the two
 * nav bars and a spinning chevron on cards.
 *
 * Which covered three components out of the whole product. A settings row, a
 * reward, a wallet card, "Tout voir", a back arrow, every form that posts to a
 * server action: press any of them on a slow connection and the screen sat
 * there, perfectly still, for a second and a half. People press again. That is
 * the report, and it is fair.
 *
 * So: one bar, at the top of everything, for every navigation in the product —
 * including the ones nobody remembered to instrument, and the ones not written
 * yet.
 *
 * ── WHY IT LISTENS FOR CLICKS INSTEAD OF ASKING THE ROUTER ────────────────
 * The App Router has no navigation-events API. useLinkStatus exists but is
 * per-<Link> — it only helps a component that already knows to ask. A global
 * listener is the only thing that can cover a product this size without
 * touching two hundred call sites, and it degrades honestly: an anchor it
 * fails to recognise simply shows no bar, exactly as today.
 *
 * ── THE DETAILS THAT MAKE IT NOT ANNOYING ─────────────────────────────────
 *   · 140ms delay. A prefetched route resolves in under that and the bar never
 *     appears, so fast navigation stays visually silent — which is the point.
 *   · It creeps toward 90% and stops. Nothing here knows the real progress and
 *     a bar that pretends to would reach 100% while the page is still coming.
 *   · pathname changing is what finishes it.
 *   · A 15s ceiling, because a bar that never leaves is worse than no bar: a
 *     download, a new tab, a cancelled navigation must not leave it stuck.
 *   · var(--cafe) with a fallback: inside a shop it is that shop's colour,
 *     everywhere else it is ours. One component, no props, right on both.

/*
  ── THE NAVIGATIONS A CLICK LISTENER CANNOT SEE ───────────────────────────

  The listener below covers <a> and <form>, which is most of the product. It
  cannot see router.push(): there is no anchor to catch and no submit event,
  so a programmatic navigation left the screen perfectly still — and those are
  not obscure call sites. BackLink is the back arrow on every diner screen and
  on owner Réglages, which makes it one of the most-pressed controls here.
  ScrollTop's own comment has said "router.push() fires no event" all along.

  So a navigation can announce itself. An event on window rather than a
  callback or a context: the callers are scattered across client components
  that have no relationship to this one, and a component that is not mounted
  simply means nobody is listening, which is the correct outcome.
