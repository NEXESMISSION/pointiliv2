/**
 * "Add Pointili to your home screen" — and the two platforms need opposite
 * things.
 *
 * ANDROID / Chrome fires `beforeinstallprompt`. Catching it and calling
 * `prompt()` later gives the real OS install sheet, which is one tap and looks
 * like installing an app. That is the whole flow.
 *
 * iOS / Safari has no such event and no API: Apple only allows install from the
 * Share sheet, by hand. There is nothing to call, so the only honest thing is to
 * SHOW the three steps. Pretending otherwise — a button that does nothing, or
 * one that opens a help page — is worse than saying it plainly.
 *
 * WHY IT ALSO MOUNTS ON THE OWNER SIDE. The cashier's till is the screen used
 * hundreds of times a week, always on the same phone, always in a hurry. An
 * installed icon removes the address bar and the "which tab was it" problem, so
 * it matters more there than on the customer side.
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST NEVER DO
 *   - appear when the app is already installed (display-mode: standalone)
 *   - appear again after being dismissed (localStorage, per surface)
 *   - appear on a desktop browser — nobody adds a till to a laptop dock, and the
 *     bar would sit over the content of a screen that has room to spare
 *   - block anything: it is a bar at the bottom, above the tab bar, dismissible
 */

/*
  ONE KEY PER SURFACE, because the till and the customer's card are two
  different apps to install. The note above has always CLAIMED "per surface";

  also silenced the one that offers a cashier their own till — an offer they
  would then never see again on the device it matters most on.

  STORAGE THAT CANNOT THROW.

  localStorage is not always there: Safari in private browsing, a browser with
  site data switched off, a quota that is full. Every one of those makes a bare
  `localStorage.setItem` raise — and this one sat on the FIRST line of dismiss(),
  in front of the setState that closes the bar. So on exactly those devices the
  close button did nothing at all: the bar stayed, and because nothing was
  written it came back on the next navigation too. A prompt you cannot get rid
  of is worse than no prompt.

  Remembering is a nicety; closing is not. These two make the nicety optional.
