/*
  The smallest service worker that makes Pointili installable, and nothing more.

  Chrome will not offer to install a site without a service worker that handles
  `fetch`. That is the entire job here. It is NOT a caching layer, and the
  restraint is the design:

  Pointili is a points ledger. Every screen a customer or a cashier looks at is a
  live balance, and a cached one is worse than no screen at all — a cashier
  reading a stale "Solde 70 points" would credit or refuse against a number that
  is no longer true. So HTML and every API/action response go straight to the
  network, always.

  The second reason is operational. A service worker that caches an app shell
  outlives the deploy that fixed it: it keeps serving yesterday's JavaScript to a
  phone that has already downloaded today's, and the only way out is a version
  bump the user has to trigger by closing every tab. At three real accounts, with
  the test database being production, that risk buys nothing.

  So: pass everything through, precache one offline page, and serve it only when
  the network genuinely is not there.
*/

/*
  Bump this whenever /hors-ligne.html changes.

  The cache key IS the version: activate deletes every key that is not this one,
  so a rename is a real reset. Leaving it alone would have left every phone that
  already installed the app serving the OLD offline screen forever — the new one
  would exist on the server and never be seen by the only people who can reach
  it.
